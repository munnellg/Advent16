# Day 8: Part 2

## Building and Running

Compile the program by running `make`

Run the resulting executable with `./d8p2 FILE` where `FILE` is one of
the input files found in the data directory.

For source code, see `main.c` in the `src` directory.

## Problem

You notice that the screen is only capable of displaying capital
letters; in the font it uses, each letter is 5 pixels wide and 6 tall.

After you swipe your card, what code is the screen trying to display?

## Solution

Trivial solution. I had already implemented Part 1 to print the
"screen" for debugging purposes. I just moved that code over and
printed the output.
